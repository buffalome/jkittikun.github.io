        "`A library in programming is a collection of pre-written code` that\n",
        "provides reusable functionality for common tasks. Libraries extend a\n",
        "programming language’s capabilities, allowing developers to utilize\n",
        "well-tested code for various functions without writing everything from\n",
        "scratch. This approach enhances productivity and enables the\n",
        "implementation of complex features more efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "Libraries in Python can be categorized into three main types:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  `Internal (Standard) Libraries`: These are included with Python’s\n",
        "    standard distribution. They provide core functionality and are\n",
        "    readily available without additional installation. Examples include\n",
        "    ‘math’, ‘datetime’, and ‘os’.\n",
        "\n",
        "2.  `Local Libraries`: These are custom modules or packages created by\n",
        "    developers for a specific project or organization. They are\n",
        "    typically stored in the project directory or a designated location\n",
        "    on the local machine. Local libraries allow for code reuse within a\n",
        "    project or across related projects within an organization.\n",
        "\n",
        "3.  `External Libraries`: These are third-party libraries developed\n",
        "    independently of the Python core. They offer specialized\n",
        "    functionality and require separate installation. Popular examples\n",
        "    include ‘numpy’ for numerical computing, ‘pandas’ for data analysis,\n",
